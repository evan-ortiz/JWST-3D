## ðŸ“Œ Abstract

The **James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)**, with its advanced infrared capabilities, enables humanity to peer back **13.5 billion years** into the early universe. Equipped with instruments such as the **Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam)** for detecting star formation and galaxy evolution, and the **Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI)** for analyzing cooler objects like planetary atmospheres and distant galaxies, JWST has opened new windows into cosmic exploration.

All JWST data are stored and made publicly available through the **Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST)**. This open-source approach allows researchers worldwide to engage with cutting-edge astrophysical datasets.

In this project, we focused on **protoplanetary disk IRAS-04385**, located **456 light-years away**, using over **200 GB of publicly available JWST data** from the MAST archive. Protoplanetary disks are dense, gas-and-dust-filled regions surrounding young stars, where planetary systems form and water, essential for life, can often be found.

Our analysis revealed that IRAS-04385 is a **promising candidate in the search for habitable worlds**, contributing to the growing catalog of over **5,500 known exoplanets**. Compared to the **2009 baseline study**, our results demonstrate a **clearer image and a broader infrared spectrum**, highlighting the progress enabled by JWST.

## ðŸ“Š Results and Impact

The spectroscopy data for IRAS-04385 shows **distinct peaks at the 7 nm and 15 nm wavelengths**, both highly associated with water. These findings strengthen the case for IRAS-04385 as a promising location in the search for life-supporting environments.

Our work contributes to reproducibility in JWST data analysis and expands the open-access tools available to the astronomy community. By demonstrating a full pipeline from **raw JWST data to visualized spectra**, this repository helps lower barriers for future researchers.

## 3. Accessing JWST Data

JWST data is hosted on the [MAST Portal](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/MASTDOCS/Portal+Guide).

- No account is required for browser downloads (tested in Chrome).
- Raw image files can be **~12 GB each**, so bulk downloads are slow.
- API access is available with documentation: [MAST API Guide](https://mast.stsci.edu/api/v0/index.html).
- JWST-specific documentation: [Accessing JWST Data](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/accessing-jwst-data).

### Dataset Selection

We used data from [Dr. Andrea Banzatti](https://news.txst.edu/research-and-innovation/2022/texas-state-physicist-to-study-water-delivery-to-exoplanets.html) (Texas State University, Physics Department). His research focuses on **gas and dust evolution in protoplanetary disks**.
