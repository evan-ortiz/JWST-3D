## ðŸ“Œ Abstract 

The **James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)**, with its advanced infrared capabilities, enables humanity to peer back **13.5 billion years** into the early universe. Equipped with instruments such as the **Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam)** for detecting star formation and galaxy evolution, and the **Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI)** for analyzing cooler objects like planetary atmospheres and distant galaxies, JWST has opened new windows into cosmic exploration.  

All JWST data are stored and made publicly available through the **Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST)**. This open-source approach allows researchers worldwide to engage with cutting-edge astrophysical datasets.  

In this project, we focused on **protoplanetary disk IRAS-04385**, located **456 light-years away**, using over **200 GB of publicly available JWST data** from the MAST archive. Protoplanetary disks are dense, gas-and-dust-filled regions surrounding young stars, where planetary systems form and water, essential for life, can often be found. 

Our analysis revealed that IRAS-04385 is a **promising candidate in the search for habitable worlds**, contributing to the growing catalog of over **5,500 known exoplanets**. Compared to the **2009 baseline study**, our results demonstrate a **clearer image and a broader infrared spectrum**, highlighting the progress enabled by JWST.

## ðŸ”® Future Directions  

Beyond reproducing scientific findings, this project lays the foundation for **future innovations and data exploration**:  
### 3D Galaxy Mapping  
- Building **3D models of the universe** using **infrared intensity and distance as axes**, creating interactive galactic maps.  
- Incorporating **graphs comparing distances from Earth** across observed stellar systems using red shift.  
- Using **predictive modeling with path exclusion** to interpolate unexplored regions of space.  
- Integrating links to open datasets from [data.nasa.gov](https://data.nasa.gov) and outreach material such as [JWST Webinars](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/jwebbinars).  
- Embedding **QR codes** to allow interactive exploration within visualizations.  

### DataCube Applications for JWST  
- Developing **DataCube analysis pipelines** for large JWST datasets.  
- Exploring connections to projects like **Q3Dfit** (spectral cube fitting) for galaxy analysis.  
- Using **lmfit (Python)** for non-linear spectral fitting.  
- Applying **ppxf (Penalized Pixel-Fitting)** for stellar population and kinematic modeling.  

### Automation and Computer Vision  
- Creating **computer vision pipelines** to automatically sift through JWST data at scale.  
- Targeting discovery of **the oldest galaxies and stellar structures** in the universe.

## 3. Accessing JWST Data  

JWST data is hosted on the [MAST Portal](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/MASTDOCS/Portal+Guide).  

- No account is required for browser downloads (tested in Chrome).  
- Raw image files can be **~12 GB each**, so bulk downloads are slow.  
- API access is available with documentation: [MAST API Guide](https://mast.stsci.edu/api/v0/index.html).  
- JWST-specific documentation: [Accessing JWST Data](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/accessing-jwst-data).  

### Dataset Selection  
We used data from [Dr. Andrea Banzatti](https://news.txst.edu/research-and-innovation/2022/texas-state-physicist-to-study-water-delivery-to-exoplanets.html) (Texas State University, Physics Department). His research focuses on **gas and dust evolution in protoplanetary disks**.  

- Target: **IRAS-04385**  
- Project Overview: [NASA Proposal 1640](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/phase2-public/1640.pdf)

## 7. Working with the Data  

### MIRI MRS Data  

- Found in the **OBS MODE = MIR_MRS** column.  
- Data is split into **3 band lengths** (SHORT, MEDIUM, LONG), with **2 channels each (12, 34)**.  
- Analysis requires processing all 6 combinations.  

**File naming notes:**  
- \`*_uncal.fits\`: Uncalibrated input data.  
- Background calibration files are downloaded into the \`crds_cache\` folder automatically.  

---

## 8. Processing Pipeline  

We used NASAâ€™s [MRS_FlightNB1 Notebook](https://github.com/STScI-MIRI/MRS-ExampleNB/blob/main/Flight_Notebook1/MRS_FlightNB1.ipynb).  

**Steps:**  
1. Place all \`uncal\` files in a \`sci_input\` folder.  
2. Run the notebook **six times**, once per band/channel pair:  
   - 12, SHORT  
   - 12, MEDIUM  
   - 12, LONG  
   - 34, SHORT  
   - 34, MEDIUM  
   - 34, LONG  

```python
use_ch = ''    # '12' or '34'
use_band = ''  # 'SHORT', 'MEDIUM', 'LONG'
```

- Runtime: ~2 hours on listed system.  
- Output: \`spectra.png\` (master wavelength table) + multiple data cubes.  

### Cube Visualization  

```bash
jdaviz --layout=cubeviz /path/to/cube.fits
```
